    <p>
        PART 1: INSTANTIATING UBUNTU SERVER INSTANCE
            * Sign into your Amazon AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com/
            * Click the launch instance button, located under the "Create Instance" header
            * Under the Ubuntu Server item, click "Select"
            * Ensure you have selected "Free Tier" before clicking "Review and Launch"
            * In order to access the server, you need to create an SSH Keypair
                ** NOTE: Be sure to save the .pem file in a memorable and safe location!
            * Use the following commands to use the keypair to access your server
                # chmod 400 (~path~)
                # ssh -i (~path~) ubuntu@(~ip address~)
            * Enter yes when asking about the authenticity of the host
    </p>

    <p>
        PART 2: SECURING UBUNTU SERVER
            * Navigate to instance and click "launch-wizard" link under "Security Groups" header of description tab
            * Under "Inbound" tab, click "Edit"
            * Click "Add Rule" and do the following
                ** Enter port range of 27017
                ** Select "My IP" option from "Source Drop-Down" menu and ensure it matches
                    *** NOTE: You can check IP address by searching "What Is My IP" on Google
            * New security rule should appear under the "Inbound" tab, with server placed behind a firewall
    </p>

    <p>
        PART 3: CREATING MONGODB DATABASE
            * Enter the following commands to have necessary dependencies for MongoDB 
                # sudo apt update
                # sudo apt install nodejs npm mongodb-clients mongodb-server
                # sudo npm install -g n forever
                # sudo n latest
            * You will have to change some lines from the following configuration (conf) file.
              WARNING: ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE TYPED IN THE INPUT CORRECTLY. TYPOS WILL CRASH YOUR PROGRAM.
                # sudo vi /etc/mongodb.conf 
                ** Alternatively, you can use "sudo nano /etc/mongodb.conf" if accustomed to nano
                ** Change line 11 by holding i to insert. Press esc to save and :wq to quit
                    # bind_ip = 0.0.0.0
            * Restart MongoDB
                # sudo service mongoDB restart
    </p>
        
    <p>
        PART 4: LINKING TO MONGODB COMPASS FOR MANAGEMENT
            * Change Hostname box to be server IP
            * Enter port from security group from PART 2
                ** 27017 is the default port range
            * Click "connect" to connect to the MongoDB
    </p>

    <p>
        PART 5: DEPLOYMENT OF FIRMWARE CODE
            * Essentially, your watch-side firmware code will pass data to the relevant HTML and JS files for the webpage
            * Plug in your watch, connected with your USB, into your computer and load the firmware
            * Push all your files to your github repository
            * Initialize the project by typing in this command
                # node (~relevant js file)
    </p>

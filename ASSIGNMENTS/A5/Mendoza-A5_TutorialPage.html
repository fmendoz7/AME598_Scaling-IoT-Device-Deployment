    <p>
        This Tutorial is about configuring a web application that displays temperature and humidity in real time to the webpage, <br />
        connected to an Ubuntu server instance using the Amazon EC2 service <br />
    </p>

        INTRODUCTION <br />
            * We are essentially running firmware on our ESP32 smartwatch, with our DHT11 sensor attached <br />
            * The watch relays temperature and humidity data to our webpage in real time <br />
            * A very high-level block diagram is attached below describing this architecture <br />

            * Our IOT watch is feeding data to our AWS Ubuntu instance (server), which is relayed to our client (webapp) <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        PART 1: INSTANTIATING UBUNTU SERVER INSTANCE <br />
            * Sign into your Amazon AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com/ <br />
            * Under "All Services", select EC2 link listed under "Compute" <br />
            <img src="https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02_aws_menu.png" alt="AWS EC2 Menu" width="400" height="400"> <br />
            * Click the launch instance button, located under the "Create Instance" header <br />
            * Under the Ubuntu Server item, click "Select" <br />
            * Ensure you have selected "Free Tier" before clicking "Review and Launch" <br />
            * In order to access the server, you need to create an SSH Keypair <br />
                ** NOTE: Be sure to save the .pem file in a memorable and safe location! <br />
            * Use the following commands to use the keypair to access your server <br />
                # chmod 400 (~path~) <br />
                # ssh -i (~path~) ubuntu@(~ip address~) <br />
            * Enter yes when asking about the authenticity of the host <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        PART 2: SECURING UBUNTU SERVER <br />
            * Navigate to instance and click "launch-wizard" link under "Security Groups" header of description tab <br />
            <img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sg_rules_desc_3.png" alt="Security Group Menu" width="400" height="400"> <br />
            * Under "Inbound" tab, click "Edit" <br />
            * Click "Add Rule" and do the following <br />
                ** Enter port range of 27017 <br />
                ** Select "My IP" option from "Source Drop-Down" menu and ensure it matches <br />
                    *** NOTE: You can check IP address by searching "What Is My IP" on Google <br />
            * New security rule should appear under the "Inbound" tab, with server placed behind a firewall <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        PART 3: CREATING MONGODB DATABASE <br />
        * Enter the following commands to have necessary dependencies for MongoDB <br />
            # sudo apt update <br />
            # sudo apt install nodejs npm mongodb-clients mongodb-server <br />
            # sudo npm install -g n forever <br />
            # sudo n latest <br />
        * You will have to change some lines from the following configuration (conf) file. <br />
        WARNING: ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE TYPED IN THE INPUT CORRECTLY. TYPOS WILL CRASH YOUR PROGRAM. <br />
            # sudo vi /etc/mongodb.conf <br />
                ** Alternatively, you can use "sudo nano /etc/mongodb.conf" if accustomed to nano <br />
                ** Change line 11 by holding i to insert. Press esc to save and :wq to quit <br />
            # bind_ip = 0.0.0.0 <br />
        * Restart MongoDB <br />
            # sudo service mongoDB restart <br />
        * Run this following command as well <br />
            # curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tejaswigowda/f289e9bff13d152876e8d4b3281142f8/raw/6baca5a568c221d5421d2bd8c1b6fd6f18a4649b/installNodeMongoUbuntu16.04.sh | bash <br />
    </p>
        
    <p>
        PART 4: LINKING TO MONGODB COMPASS FOR MANAGEMENT <br />
        * Change Hostname box to be server IP <br />
        * Enter port from security group from PART 2 <br />
        ** 27017 is the default port range <br />
        * Click "connect" to connect to the MongoDB <br />

    </p>

    <p>
        PART 5: DEPLOYMENT OF TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY FIRMWARE CODE <br />
            * Essentially, your watch-side firmware code will pass data to the relevant HTML and JS files for the webpage <br />
            * Plug in your watch, connected with your USB, into your computer and load the firmware <br />
            * There are 3 two webpages displaying analytical data for this <br />
                ** dailyAvg.html <br />
                ** history.html <br />
            * Push all your files to your github repository <br />
            * Initialize the project by typing in this command <br />
                # node server.js <br />
